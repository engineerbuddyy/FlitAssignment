This project demonstrates a dynamic, backend-driven dashboard screen built using Jetpack Compose and MVVM architecture.
Widgets are rendered purely based on metadata received from a backend source, without hardcoded UI positions.

📌 Problem Statement

🔴 Build a dashboard screen that:

🔴 Displays a vertical list of widgets

🔴 Renders widgets only from backend metadata

🔴 Supports multiple instances of the same widget type

🔴 Ensures widget state is isolated using instanceId

🔴 Uses Jetpack Compose and MVVM

🔴 Avoids business logic inside composables.


📌Architecture Overview

    UI (Compose)

        ↓
 
    ViewModel

        ↓
 
    Domain (Repository Interface, Models)'

        ↓
 
    Data (Repository Implementation, Fake APIs)



📌 Key Design Principles


🔴 UI is stateless and renders data only

🔴 ViewModels own all logic and state

🔴 Repositories abstract data sources

🔴 Each widget instance is independent


   🔄 Data Flow

🔴 DashboardViewModel fetches widget metadata from the repository

🔴 DashboardScreen renders widgets dynamically using this metadata

🔴 For each widget:

🔴 Banner widgets receive static data and render immediately

🔴 List widgets create their own ViewModel using instanceId

    🔄 Each List widget:

🔴 Fetches data independently

🔴 Manages its own loading / success / error state


📦 Widget Metadata Format

{

       "type": "banner" | "list",
  
       "instanceId": "string"
  
}

Example response:

[

      { "type": "banner", "instanceId": "pokemon" },
  
      { "type": "banner", "instanceId": "cars" },
  
      { "type": "banner", "instanceId": "bikes" },
   
      { "type": "list", "instanceId": "movies" },
  
      { "type": "list", "instanceId": "shows" }
  
]


The UI renders widgets in the same order as the metadata.

🧱 Widgets Implemented

   1️⃣ Banner Widget

🔴 Stateless

🔴 Fully driven by data

🔴 Displays one or more banners

🔴 Uses LazyRow for horizontal scrolling


BannerWidget(banners: List<BannerConfig>)


  2️⃣ List Widget

🔴 Stateful

🔴 Fetches data using a fake API

🔴 Handles:

🔴 Loading

🔴 Success

🔴 Error

Each instance owns its state via instanceId


ListWidget(instanceId: String)


   🔐 State Isolation Using instanceId

🔴 Each List widget:

🔴 Receives a unique instanceId

🔴 Creates its own ViewModel

🔴 Fetches data independently

🔴 ListWidgetViewModel(instanceId)



This guarantees:

🔴 Same widget type can appear multiple times

🔴 No shared state between widget instances

🔴 One widget failure does not affect others


🧠 Key Takeaway

The UI is fully driven by backend metadata, widget state is isolated using instanceId, and the architecture cleanly separates concerns using MVVM and Jetpack Compose best practices.
